## Requirements
### Hardware Requirements
- Use the TivaC board
- Use SW1 as an input button
- Use the RGB LED
### Software Requirements
- **The RGB LED is OFF initially**
- The PWM signal has a 500ms duration
- The system has four states:
- SW1 - First press
  - The Green LED will be on with a 30% duty cycle
- SW1 - Second press
  - The Green LED will be on with a 60% duty cycle
- SW1 -Third press
  - The Green LED will be on with a 90% duty cycle
- SW1 - Fourth press will be off
  - The Green LED will be off
- On the fifth press, system state will return to state 1

### Implement your drivers
- Implement the General Purpose Timer (GPT) driver
  - GPT Driver shall support APIs like:( Initialization, starting a timer in microseconds,  milliseconds, and seconds, stopping the timer, getting elapsed time, getting remaining time, enabling interrupts, disable interrupts, and a callback.)
